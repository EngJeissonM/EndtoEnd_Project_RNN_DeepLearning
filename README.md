# EndtoEnd_Project_RNN_DeepLearning
This project is an end-to-end Sentiment Analysis web application built using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The app allows users to enter a movie review and classifies it as Positive or Negative using a pre-trained deep learning model.
